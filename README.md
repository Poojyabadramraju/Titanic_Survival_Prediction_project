# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_project
This project aims to predict the survival outcomes of the passengers on board the Titanic ship that sank in 1912,using machine learning language techniques.
The famous titanic dataset from kaggle has been used in this project consisting of passenger features,such as sex,age,class,etc., to train and test the models and evaluate their performance.
This project also explores the data and the factors that influenced the survival chances of the passengers.
